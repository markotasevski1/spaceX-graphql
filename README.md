## Getting Started
### I am new with graphql and this repo is for learning purposes

Im using [spaceX graphql API](https://studio.apollographql.com/public/SpaceX-pxxbxen/variant/current/home) for demo and learning purposes.

### Description

In this project, we'll implement a feature where we fetch information about all SpaceX launches from their API. This will be done on server using server components. For each launch, the application will dynamically create a dedicated page that provides more comprehensive details and information specific to that particular launch.
