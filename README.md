## Getting Started
### I am new with graphql and this repo is for learning purposes

Within the [apollo blog page](https://www.apollographql.com/blog/community/backend/8-free-to-use-graphql-apis-for-your-projects-and-demos/) you'll find a multitude of GraphQL APIs. For this project i will be using [spaceX graphql API](https://studio.apollographql.com/public/SpaceX-pxxbxen/variant/current/home) 

### Description

In this project, we'll implement a feature where we fetch information about all SpaceX launches from their API. This will be done on server using server side components. For each launch, the application will dynamically create a dedicated page that provides more comprehensive details and information specific to that particular launch.

Im using Nextjs 13 with app directory and tailwind for styling
